# Summary

<!--  Summary: Has a clear description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience been provided? -->

`Zoobot` is a Python package for measuring the detailed appearance of galaxies in telescope images
using deep learning.
`Zoobot` is aimed at astronomers who want to solve a galaxy image task such as finding merging galaxies or counting spiral arms.
Astronomers can use `Zoobot` to adapt (finetune) pretrained deep learning models to solve their task.
These finetuned models perform better and require far fewer new labels than training from scratch [@Walmsley2022Towards].

The models included with `Zoobot` are pretrained on up to 92 million responses from [Galaxy Zoo](www.galaxyzoo.org) volunteers.
Each volunteer answers a series of tasks describing the detailed appearance of each galaxy.
`Zoobot`'s models are trained to answer all of these diverse tasks simultaneously.
The models can then be adapted to new related tasks.

`Zoobot` provides a high-level API and guided workflow for carrying out the finetuning process.
The API abstracts away engineering details such as efficiently loading astronomical images, multi-GPU training, iteratively finetuning deeper model layers, and so forth.
Behind the scenes, these steps are implemented via either PyTorch or TensorFlow, according to the user's choice.
`Zoobot` is therefore accessible to astronomers with no previous experience in deep learning.

For advanced users, `Zoobot` also includes the code to replicate and extend our pretrained models.
This is used routinely at [Galaxy Zoo](www.galaxyzoo.org) to scale up galaxy measurement catalogs [@Walmsley2022decals]
and to prioritise the galaxies shown to volunteers for labelling.
Zoobot models have been applied to measure galaxy appearance in SDSS [@Walmsley2020], Hubble, HSC, and DESI, and are included in the data pipeline of upcoming space telescope Euclid [@2011arXiv1110.3193L].
We hope that `Zoobot` will help empower astronomers to apply deep learning to answer their own science questions.

# Statement of need
<!-- A statement of need: Does the paper have a section titled ‘Statement of need’ that clearly states what problems the software is designed to solve, who the target audience is, and its relation to other work? -->
<!-- State of the field: Do the authors describe how this software compares to other commonly-used packages? -->

One common way to investigate why galaxies look the way they do is by measuring
the appearance - morphology - of millions of galaxies and looking for connections between appearance and other physical properties [@Masters2019a].
The sheer number of images requires most of these measurement to be made automatically with software [@Walmsley2020].

Unfortunately, making automated measurements of complicated features like spiral arms is difficult because
it is hard to write down a set of steps that reliably identify those and only those features.
This mirrors many image classification problems back on Earth [@LeCun2015].
Astronomers often aim instead to learn the measurement steps directly from data
by providing deep learning models with large sets of galaxy images with labels (e.g. spiral or not) [@HuertasCompany2022].

Gathering large sets of labelled galaxy images is a major practical barrier.
Models trained on millions to billions of labelled images consistently perform better [@Bommasani2021;@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2302.05442], but astronomers cannot routinely label this many images.
Neither can most other people;
terrestrial practictioners often start with a model already trained ("pretrained")
on a broad generic task and then adapt it ("finetune") to their specific measurement task `[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2104.10972].

Zoobot makes this approach available to astronomers.
We provide models pretrained on millions of galaxy images and present a convenient API for finetuning those models.
Early results [@Walmsley2022Towards;@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2303.00366] show that our pretrained models can be efficiently adapted to new morphology tasks.
<!-- We will continue to improve our pretraining methods to create adaptable galaxy "foundation" models and to make those models available to the community via Zoobot. -->
